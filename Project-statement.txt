Design and implement a comand line Debugger for SimpleRisc Programs with following functionalities:

1.load prog.mem     //this should load prog.mem on memory 
2.run               //should run from the begining
3.break <address>   //should set the breakpoint at memory address given by user
4.continue          //run from the current instruction till the breakpoint is hit, or till end of execution
5.step              //execute one instruction
6.print r <number>   //print the content of a register
7.print m <address> //print the content of memory location
